        <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
        <p>
          AuthorBeacon was born from a deep understanding of how isolating the
          writing journey can be. We exist to offer warmth, knowledge, and
          connection to independent authors navigating their creative paths.

        <h2>What We Believe</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Every story matters</strong> — and every storyteller
            deserves support.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Community is power</strong> — collaboration over
            competition.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Access to tools is access to opportunity</strong> — we offer
            guidance, not gatekeeping.
          </li>
